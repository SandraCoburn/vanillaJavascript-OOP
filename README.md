#### Programming Paradigms (Procedural vs Object Oriented vs Functional)

- `Procedural` - Write a sequencial series of execution steps/tasks. Top to bottom code execution.
- `Object-oriented` - Organize data and logic objects (properties + methods). Organize code in logical entities.
- `Functional` - Organize code in (pure) functions with clearly defined tasks. Pass data around via parameters.
